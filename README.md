# Lightning Detection (ECE4180)

## Introduction
The idea behind this project is to create a personal device internet for outdoor recreation (ex. hiking, camping, ...) that alerts the user of lightning detected de to nearby storms. The personal device will mainly take advantage of the “SparkFun Lightning Detector - AS3935” coupled with a screen, small speaker, LEDs, haptic feedback, or some other kind of indicator to alter the user when a strike is detected and approximately how far away it is. This device could also be connected to your mobile device through Bluetooth to also notify the user on their phone. We are also interested in logging the strikes detected by multiple devices,  either locally or by sending them to some database to be able to trilateral the exact location of all the lightning strikes detected. This can be useful for real-time alerts or analysis of a storm system. This can be imagined by also including an SD card for local logging or a WiFi transceiver for remote logging.
